# C_Programming_Results
In this repository ill upload the c progamming lessons i teach in my college H.I.T.
each week we have a class where me and my students solve the given lab questions.

the objective of this repository is that the students can read and understand the solutions in case they did not understand
something in the class itself and were to shy to ask.

also - other people can read it and share their honorable opinion about the solution or if they have a better one.
